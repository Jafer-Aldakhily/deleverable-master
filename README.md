**I created a Camertac project, which is a social media for photographers used to share the images, so any photographer can use it to upload or search on images, which is helping them to improve their skills, and enhance their performance.

Now, I would like to tell you how we can use a project in the simplest scenario.
So firstly you need to visit our site and logged in, then you will show the images for other photographers, which is containing the All type of images, and user can clustering the result by selecting any category, and user can search for any image.**
